Windows 7 (Video)](https://robwillis.info/2013/08/setting-up-a-dedicated-minecraft-server-video/) - Running your own Minecraft server is a great way to share your games and connect with friends.

- [What is ESXi? (Video)](https://robwillis.info/2013/09/what-is-esxi-video/) - I often find myself talking about VMWare's ESXi and how useful it can be in lab and production environments where you need to make the most of your hardware. For those who aren't familiar with ESXi or virtualization, the first question usually is "What exactly is ESXi?". The answer however isn't exactly all the easy to explain, so I decided to make a quick video that shows exactly what ESXi looks like and how it is managed. This is not intended to be a tutorial or an in depth look at virtualization, but a quick glimpse at how ESXi works from the base server hardware to managing the server/virtual machines via the vSphere console.
- [IIS 7/7.5 Hardening SSL TLS - Windows Server 2008 R2](https://robwillis.info/2013/09/iis-77-5-hardening-ssl-tls-windows-server-2008-r2/) - One of the first steps you should do when deploying a new public facing web server is hardening your server's SSL/TLS connections.

Traditionally PHP runs on IIS either as an ISAPI extension or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program, running PHP via FastCGI can be a great way to improve performance depending on your application. In this video I demonstrate how to manually setup and configure PHP via FastCGI using PHP 5.5.4 on IIS. You'll want to make sure you use the Non Thread Safe version of php!

Shortly after the last time I posted on updating firmwares on Dell PowerEdge R610, I found out that Dell dropped support for all 11G servers from the SUU package along with the Lifecycle controller packages which basically broke the entire method I posted. However all hope is not lost, and the newest images are still available for download via the Dell support page. This method is not as streamlined or quick as the SUU or Lifecycle Controller methods, however once you have everything downloaded and the USB drives created, the process is still fairly easy and repeatable. You can find my blog post with all of the commands and links here:
